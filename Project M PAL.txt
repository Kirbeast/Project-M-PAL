Project M Codes ported: 98/486
Untested: 8

Issues:
- Noticed that the Stage Select Option String was messed up (german)
- Item switch lags the game in Dolphin
- Sometimes there is lag in Dolphin

PAL crashing files:
/pf
+-system
+--common3.pac *it misses a few data sections, which we have to add manually. Brawlbox does not support importing misc byte data.
+-info2
+--info.pac

PAL language specific files:
- They will not be replaced by the FPC (File Patch Code) so far
- The character menu, title screen, and intro sequence does get replaced like in the NTSC version
- The character menu is language specific, so I don't know why it gets replaced. 
- We need to make a new code so we can replace these files, or we try to make it work that every language is just english or default (like in NTSC).

Custom Music:
- Works.

Custom Stage: (I am using the data from the netplay version. So thing might be different for the offical 3.6)
- metal cavern: crashes
- saffron city: crashes
- wario land: crashes
- fountain of dreams has a fixed camera (there might be a code for this)
- yoshi's story collision does not match
- (battlefield loads the brawl version, could be a netplay thing)
- pokestad2 is glitched. collisions are wrong and it starts as a transformed version.
- defino secret: crashes
- kongo jungle (rebalanced): crashes 
- rumble falls: crashes

Characters:
- mario: attacks seem to work, but randomly crashes the game when performing them. Also something doing an aerial attack with Z changes the camera mode.
- dk: same as mario
- link: same as mario
- samus: when selected, crashes the game
- kirby: modified up b doesn't work, no flames with running A
- fox: fire doesn't make any sound. sometimes the fire sounds get looped over and over. also crashes the game
- pikachu: crashes the game. does not do any voices.
- marth: crashes
- g&w: crashes when attacking

Bugs:
- With CSS on, Random gives characters a different character profile. Can also crash the game. Glitch occurs more often in PAL
- Training doesn't work. Doesn't affect NTSC (deleting info2->info_training.pac should work)

Mode Idea:
- Increase Shield Strength and Shield Recovery
- Decrease Shield Break Stun
- Increase Smash Attack Multiplier
