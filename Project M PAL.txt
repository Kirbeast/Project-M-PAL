Project M Codes ported: 215/486
Untested: 276

Issues:
- Noticed that the Stage Select Option String was messed up (german)

PAL crashing files:
/pf
+-info2
+--info.pac

PAL language specific files:
- They will not be replaced by the FPC (File Patch Code) so far
- The character menu, title screen, and intro sequence does get replaced like in the NTSC version
- The character menu is language specific, so I don't know why it gets replaced. 
- We need to make a new code so we can replace these files, or we try to make it work that every language is just english or default (like in NTSC).

Custom Music:
- Works.

Custom Stage:
- rumble falls: crashes

Characters: Aerials, Jab, and dash crash the game
- kirby: modified up b doesn't work, no flames with running A
- samus: selcting samus at the css crashes the game
