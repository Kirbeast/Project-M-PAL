# Project M PAL
As the offical developement of Project M and therefore the PAL port has been cancelled, we will port it.  
Be aware that this is **experimental!** While there shouldn't be any issues when testing on a real console, please do so only if you are experienced enough.

# Updating the Codes (Dolphin)
I've included a Batch file that updates the Codes in the "SD.raw". You need a folder "tools" with jwiicm in it and ImDisk installed.
